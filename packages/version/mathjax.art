                                This package provides a wrapper arround [mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/), to display math equations in an arturo's webview
                                
                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                
                                ```red
                                import "mathjax"!

                                .title: "Pythagorean triples"
                                ---------------
                                The general form for generating all primitive Pythagorean triples 
                                (where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are coprime) is given by the following parametrization.
                                For two positive integers $m$ and $n$ with $m > n$, $m - n$ odd, and $\gcd(m, n) = 1$,
                                the triple $(a, b, c)$ is given by:
                                $$a = m^2 - n^2, \quad b = 2mn, \quad c = m^2 + n^2.$$
                                
                                This produces a Pythagorean triple because:
                                $$
                                (m^2 - n^2)^2 + (2mn)^2 = m^4 - 2m^2n^2 + n^4 + 4m^2n^2 = m^4 + 2m^2n^2 + n^4 = (m^2 + n^2)^2.
                                $$
                                Thus, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, satisfying the Pythagorean theorem.
                                ```

                                Mathjax.art has been designed with flexibility and extensibility in mind.
                                
                                - Can you make it work offline?
                                - Have you noticed an error and want to fix sth?
                                - Do you want to add more options?
                                - Do you want to add more tests to an inject to make it more robust?
