# ğŸ“– Description

Write a few things about what this new package does (main use cases, category, etc)

## ğŸ“¦ New package

- [ ] I have updated the [packages/list.art](https://github.com/arturo-lang/pkgr.art/blob/main/packages/list.art):
    * All you have to do is add an entry like:
       ```red
       packageName: "owner/repo"
       ```
- [ ] The repo in question is formatted as a valid Arturo package:
    * either have a `main.art` file and/or an `info.art` file specifying the entry point, `depends` and `requires`
- [ ] There is at least one published release:
    * Arturo's package manager versioning uses the published releases' tags which have to conform to SemVer
